Good day. Since the beginning of my work in 2014, I've been planning to create one personal website. Finally, I've started it in a Lazy weekend.

My plan was to use own infrastructure to host my site so that I can do whatever I want with production :grin:. But my wallet doesn't like that idea, so I've to drop the idea and start with hybrid one which I will share in another post.

My goal is to share my career experience, productivity tips, tutorials and guidelines. Actually, find a lazy day and share whatever comes to my mind.

Let's see how the seed develops.
